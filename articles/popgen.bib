  abstract = {Simulation studies by Ohta, and theoretical studies by Shimizu, indicated that the alleles in one chromosome multigene family follow Ewens' sampling distribution at stationarity. The reasons for this are explored, and the theory is extended to obtain transient and stationary results for the sampling distribution. Expressions are obtained for the amount of variation of numbers of alleles across the chromosomes in a population. The population model includes mutation, and gene conversion, but not recombination.},

  abstract = {Shimizu's model for the evolution of multigene families, subject to gene conversion and mutation, is studied. The probability distribution for the allelic configuration of two chromosomes is found, by using "coalescent" methods. For the two chromosomes, moments are found for the number of alleles they have in common and for their total number of alleles, together with the probability that there is only one allele present. Some numerical examples are given.},
