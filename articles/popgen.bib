  abstract = {When an advantageous mutation is fixed in a population by selection, a closely linked selectively neutral or mildly detrimental mutation may "hitchhike" to fixation along with it. It has been suggested that hitchhiking might increase the rate of molecular evolution. Computer simulations and a mathematical argument show that complete linkage to either advantageous or deleterious mutations does not affect the substitution of selectively neutral mutations. However, the simulations show that linkage to selected background mutations decreases the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations and increases the rate of fixation of detrimental mutations. This is true whether the linked background mutations are advantageous or detrimental, and it verifies and extends previous observations that linkage tends to reduce the effects of selection on evolution. These results can be interpreted in terms of the Hill-Robertson effect: a locus linked to another locus under selection experiences a reduction in effective population size. The interpretation of differences in evolutionary rates between different genomes or different regions of a genome may be confounded by the effects of strong linkage and selection. Recombination is expected to reduce the overall rate of molecular evolution while enhancing the rate of adaptive evolution.},

Simulation results are presented to indicate the accuracy of the approximations. The results concerning the number of segregating sites and the expected homozygosity indicate that a two-locus model and the infinite-site model behave similarly for 4Nu less than or equal to 2 and r less than or equal to 5u, where N is the population size, u is the neutral mutation rate, and r is the recombination rate. Simulations of a two-locus model and a four-locus model were also carried out to determine the effect of intragenic recombination on the homozygosity test of Watterson (Genetics 85, 789-814; 88, 405-417) and on the number of unique alleles in a sample.

The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

  abstract = {Within-population variation at the DNA level will rarely be studied by sequencing of loci of randomly chosen individuals. Instead, individuals will usually be chosen for sequencing based on some knowledge of their genotype. Data collected in this way require new sampling theory. Motivated by these observations, we have examined the sampling properties of a finite population model with two mutation processes and with no selection or recombination. One mutation process generates new alleles according to an infinite-alleles model, and the other generates polymorphisms at sites according to an infinite-sites model. A sample of n genes is considered. The stationary distribution of the number of segregating sites in a subsample from one of the allelic classes in the sample conditional on the allelic configuration of the sample is studied. A recursive scheme is developed to compute the moments of this distribution, and it is shown that the distribution is functionally independent of the number of additional alleles in the sample and their respective frequencies in the sample. For the case in which the sample contains only two alleles, the distribution of the number of segregating sites in a subsample containing both alleles conditional on the sample frequencies of the alleles is studied. The results are applied to the analysis of DNA sequences of two alleles found at the Adh locus of Drosophila melanogaster. No significant departure from the neutral model is detected.},

The analysis is based on the model proposed by Langley et al. describing the evolution of a family of selectively neutral transposable elements in a finite haploid population of size 2N. By considering the time back to the most recent common ancestor of two copies, both the probability of identity and the moments of the number of sites that differ between two sampled copies are obtained. Our analytic results are consistent with the numerical results of Ohta for a similar model. The effects of gene conversion are also examined. In agreement with Slatkin, we find that gene conversion has a minimal effect on the probability of identity providing that the rate of deletion is sufficiently large.},

Thus, the statistical properties of the genealogical process for a random sample at a neutral locus linked to a locus with selection follow from the results obtained for the selected locus. Sequence data from the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region of Drosophila melanogaster are examined and compared to predictions based on the theory. It is found that the spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between Fast and Slow alleles of Adh is very similar to the spatial distribution predicted if balancing selection operates to maintain the allozyme variation at the Adh locus. The spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between different Slow alleles of Adh do not match the predictions of this simple model very well.},

The statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or nucleon diversity is investigated using this theory. These studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic factors.

  abstract = {The most powerful, and most frequently used, test of selective neutrality, based on data consisting of observed allelic frequencies in a sample of genes at some locus, is the procedure of G. A. Watterson. This procedure uses the sample homozygosity F* as the test statistic, and in effect leads to rejection of the hypothesis of selective neutrality if the observed value of F* differs significantly from neutral theory expectations. The homozygosity statistic is invariant under relabeling of the alleles and thus cannot use any further information on the alleles which might be available. We present results which suggest that information concerning the age order of the alleles cannot be used to provide a more powerful testing procedure than that of Watterson.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that the Ewens sampling formula may be generated by a Polya-like urn model. A genealogical proof of this result equates the labelling of balls in the urn to the partition by age of alleles in the sample. This urn construction is shown to be equivalent to the construction of Kingman (Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 361 (1978), 1-20) using a Poisson-Dirichlet "paintbox" and as a consequence, the partition by ages is seen to be equivalent to the size biased permutation of the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. This approach unifies and extends many results on ages of alleles, the Polya urn, and the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. Furthermore the Ewens sampling formula is characterized as being the only partition structure which may be generated by an urn-like mechanism.},

The process records population frequencies in old and new classes, and labels the new classes in order of decreasing age. Its marginal distribution is characterized in a form which is amenable to explicit calculations and the transition densities of the associated K-allele models follow readily from this representation.},
